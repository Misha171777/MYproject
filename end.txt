......you find yourself back in the comfort of your home , sitting at your dinner table 
a comforting silence surrounds you , such a lovely feeling to be home , but now you're contemplating..
was it all a dream...?

it all felt too vivid to be a dream , to surreal at the same time
you yawn and look around , something catches your attention.

on your fridge , a shiny magnet holds a bunch of pitcures , it's all you...
 a picture of you iin Fortuna , a picture of you in Windrise , a picture of you in Aigis

 "what..what is this??" you mutter to yourself
 a note is attached with the pictures that says 


"was a fun adventurine...wasn't?"
