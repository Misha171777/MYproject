
....you encounter a bright futuristic city , immenslu huge skyscrapers all arounf , vehicles floting around yoiu
as you watch in awe from the sidewalk , the city night lights are truly magnificant , to see the future with your own eyes
it's fascinating

you stride along the sidewalk still observing the city , you look up to see the holographic advertisments
colorful moving images on the glass surface  of the skyscrapers , they seem to be alive
what a sight to behold , 


you walk and watch in amazment for what seems like....hours
until you look around the corner to see a small dark alley , something is pulling you to it

a sense of familiarity , you walk down  the alley , it's narrow and dimly lit , you can't see much
until you fall into a hole and slide down till you reach the end.
